The Ethereum creator railed that Nayib Bukele "loves being praised" and said "shame on Bitcoin maximalists who are uncritically praising him."

In a surprise Reddit post on Friday, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin had strong words for El Salvador's Bitcoin rollout, and specifically President Nayib Bukele for forcing local businesses to accept the top cryptocurrency.
After a Reddit user on the r/cryptocurrency subreddit posted: "Unpopular opinion: El Salvador president Mr Nayab (sic) Bukele should not be praised by crypto community," Buterin replied: "Nothing unpopular about this opinion. Making it mandatory for businesses to accept a specific cryptocurrency is contrary to the ideals of freedom that are supposed to be so important to the crypto space."
Buterin's post continued: "This tactic of pushing BTC to millions of people in El Salvador at the same time with almost no attempt at prior education is reckless, and risks a large number of innocent people getting hacked or scammed. Shame on everyone (ok, fine, I'll call out the main people responsible: shame on Bitcoin maximalists) 
who are uncritically praising him."
Indeed, Bukele's embrace of Bitcoin as legal tender, first announced with great fanfare at the Bitcoin Miami conference in June, has earned him raves from some of the loudest voices in Bitcoin. Those same Bitcoin flag-wavers have been less eager to talk about the young president's well-documented authoritarian tendencies and the less 
savory aspects of his government's Bitcoin rollout. One Salvadoran business owner, requiring anonymity, told Decrypt, "It crushes my soul to see Bitcoin maximalists around the world cheering this when, if they actually sat down and read the law and regulations, it is completely opposite to everything they preach."
And Buterin isn't the only voice in crypto speaking out about the contradictions in forcing an open, decentralized technology on business owners.
At the TOKEN2049 conference in London just this week, Blockchain.com co-founder Nicolas Cary said during a panel, "I think there’s some valid criticisms of how the program is rolled out in El Salvador in terms of being top down. One of the main ethos of crypto is that there’s really grassroots adoption, and people are doing it voluntarily."
Buterin didn't stop at his first post. Further down in the same thread, when the original poster commented: "It's like [Bukele] pushed it because he bought at cheaper price and knew a country adopting a crypto would alone take the price high enough to make him rich," Buterin replied, "Simpler and dumber hypothesis: both for political 
reasons and because he's a human being like the rest of us, he just loves being praised by people he considers powerful (ie. Americans). Bitcoin maximalists are a very 
easy community to get to praise you: you just have to be in a position of power and do or say nice things about them and their coin."
The original poster replied to Buterin: "Elon did the same exact thing, now Bukele exploiting emotions of the community."

Senator Cynthia Lummis backs her support for cryptocurrencies by increasing her BTC holdings. Her latest purchase in August saw her purchase between $50K to $100K worth of Bitcoins.
Through a Periodic Transaction Report filed in conjunction with the rules, it was disclosed that Senator Lummis had increased her BTC holdings through her latest purchase. The buy was effectuated through a U.S Bitcoin exchange, River Financial on August 16 and is valued between $50,000 – $100,000.
The filing was done outside the 45-day window provided by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, which a spokesperson from the Senator’s office noted 
was “an honest mistake” due to a filing error. The Act was enacted to prohibit members and employees of Congress from utilizing non-public information for private profit. However, the 45-day rule does not apply to some assets like Treasury bills and EIFs but they still need to be unveiled once a year. The spokesperson from the Senator’s office noted that the issue had been resolved with no penalties after clarification with the Ethics committee. 
At the time of her purchase, BTC was trading at around $45K and now trades at $55,074. The Wyoming Senator’s purchase was done barely two weeks after she attempted to include an amendment to limit the definition of who could be considered as a cryptocurrency broker under the Infrastructure Bill.
Senator Lummis’ affiliation with Bitcoins began in 2013 when she first purchased the asset class. At the time, Bitcoin traded around $320 and in April 2021, her BTC holdings were anywhere between $100,000 – $250,000.
In an interview with CNBC, she remarked that she would like “to see cryptocurrency, like bitcoin, become part of a diversified asset allocation that is used in retirement funds and other opportunities for people to save for the future”. She was a guest at the Bitcoin Conference in 2021 and has revealed that she embraced the asset class because she was on the lookout for “great stores of value”.
Despite her support for the asset class, Lummis has criticized the recent regime of stablecoins and has called for increased cryptocurrency regulation for them. She noted that they should 100% be cash-backed and audits must be regularly conducted for investor protection. Aside from Lummis, Sen. Pat Toomey has also made a sizable investment in cryptocurrencies after he purchased $15,000 in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust in June.
American regulators remain indecisive on their stance on cryptocurrencies. The move by a serving Senator to purchase a considerable sum of BTC adds as a small win for cryptocurrency enthusiasts who are hoping for a flexible regime of regulations.

Tokyo-based crypto exchange Mt. Gox shut down in 2014 after it lost Bitcoin (BTC) worth $450 million at the time to unknown hackers. The hack and the subsequent closure of what was then one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world affected nearly 24,000 creditors. 
In June 2018, Japanese courts green-lighted a petition for a civil rehabilitation that will allow Mt. Gox creditors to get compensation for their losses, but the process was marked by delays and legal disputes. In December 2020, the Tokyo District Court accepted the current draft of the rehabilitation plan and then issued an order in 
February to allow claimants to vote on it. 
The voting process began on May 31 giving creditors over four months to cast their votes either by mail or electronically. The voting period ended on Friday, October 8. 
At least half of the creditors’ voting shares should vote “yes” to pass the plan.  Prior to the deadline, Blockstream founder Adam Back urged claimants to cast their votes since the votes of those who failed to respond are automatically considered a “no.”
LAST REMINDER if you got @mtgox'ed you really need to vote for the rehabilitation plan. missing votes count as NO (stupid I know). if they don't get enough YES votes matching > 50% of claim value, you don't get paid. VOTE NOW vote ends TOMORROW friday 8th https://t.co/XH5e8BtTnA
As to whether or not the rehabilitation plan was approved, a coordinator of the creditors’ group MtGoxLegal reportedly said that creditors have been asking the Tokyo District court representative and the Trustee for an indication of whether or not the yes votes met the 50 percent threshold. 
“If we had been able to get an update, say, after half of the voting period had passed, and that update indicated that the participation rate in the vote was worryingly low, then we could have tried to fundraise and allocate those funds to bring more attention to the issue,” the unnamed coordinator told Coindesk.
If the plan is accepted, creditors would be partially compensated for their losses in Japanese yen, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Otherwise, the process would revert 
to Mt. Gox bankruptcy.
The MtGoxLegal coordinator said that there is a huge difference between what creditors would get under the civil rehabilitation plan and what they would receive if the 
process is reverted to bankruptcy, so claimants are likely to vote in support of the rehabilitation plan.

Powercrypto Holdings, a subsidiary of the blockchain software provider Powerbridge Technologies, is launching cryptocurrency mining, specifically Bitcoin (BTC)and Ethereum (ETH), in Hong Kong. These cryptocurrency operations will utilize environmental-friendly, green, and sustainable energy. This announcement was made in a press release on Friday, October 8, 2021
Powerbridge Technologies is a growth-driven technology company primarily engaged in SaaS solutions and Blockchain applications.
Powerbridge Technologies plans to deploy a total of 2,600 high-performance mining rigs in Hong Kong, including 600 BTC mining machines working at a hash rate of approximately 60 PH/s. It also includes 2,000 ETH mining machines, with a hash rate power of approximately 1,000 GH/s.
According to the announcement, Powercrypto aims to increase the BTC and ETH hash rate levels across the North American and Asian markets.

Sean Wang, Powercrypto’s General Manager and Chief Technology Officer, stated that: “Powercrypto is a major strategic move by the Company to highlight our global presence in the crypto-mining business. We will focus on enhancing our overall hash rate level in BTC and ETH mining by setting up mining fleets in North America and Asia.”  
In its global BTC and ETH mining, the company plans to focus on maximizing the use of carbon-free clean energy power. Powerbridge Technologies President Stewart Lor, also commented, “We are very excited about our launch and positioning as a global presence in the cryptocurrency mining business. We expect our high-performance environmental-friendly crypto-mining fleets to significantly accelerate our revenue.”

Powerbridge Technologies states that it plans to increase its bitcoin miners with an expected capacity of 10,000 miners and an expected hash rate of 728 PH/S. Additionally, according to the company, its proprietary AI/GPU operating system can support up to 100,000 ETH miners in operation.
Powerbridge Technologies established Powercrypto Holdings, its new Singapore-based subsidiary for its Crypto Mining and Digital Asset operations, late last month.      
Powercrypto focuses on green renewable energy-powered crypto mining farms with its intended worldwide operations. The announcement states that the subsidiary strives to become one of the most competitive Bitcoin and Ethereum mining companies. The President of Powerbridge Technologies believes that Powerbridge is well-positioned to accelerate the growth of its crypto businesses and generate promising revenue from it.

A few days ago, the company announced the appointment of Sean X. Wang as General Manager and Chief Technology Officer of Powercrypto Holdings. Mr. Wang, a blockchain expert, was brought on to lead the operations and technology development of Powercrypto’s crypto mining business. He reportedly has wide-ranging expertise in the fields of crypto mining and digital assets operations, having managed and operated mining fleets with nearly forty thousand Bitcoin and Ethereum mining rigs.
Hong Kong has played a crucial role in the history of cryptocurrencies. It is the birthplace of some of the world’s largest crypto companies. Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin, was also launched here.
Hong Kong is a metropolitan area and special administrative region of China. Therefore, unfavorable regulations have affected the digital assets space in the region. However, it has been making efforts to develop its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), e-HKD since 2017.

Major coins increased in value this week.

This week brought good news for investors in Cryptoland. Bitcoin went up 15%, Ethereum up 8% and some coins, such as the Dogecoin spinoff Shiba Inu (SHIB) coin, rose by 266%. 
Bitcoin (BTC) had actually started rising well over a week ago. On September 29, well before the current week started, the coin began its quick crawl upward from lows of $41,211. By Monday, it had reached $47,355, but the coin was only just getting started.

By Wednesday, it had rushed through $50,000 to hit $51,473. Then a lot of leveraged trading brought it to today’s price of $55,167. “There is a lot more leverage in the market than last year. Open Interest (OI) is more than triple,” said Singaporean crypto prop shop QCP Capital in a Telegram group. 
At $1 trillion, Bitcoin’s market cap is now larger than the combined market caps of JPMorgan and Bank of America. Itay Tuchman, Citi bank’s global head of foreign exchange said that institutional interest in Bitcoin is growing. “Like anyone who’s in crypto knows, you start with Bitcoin and you’re down the rabbit hole very quickly,” he said this week.
The price of Ethereum (ETH) increased from lows of $3,287 on Monday to highs of $3,656 on Friday. Its current price is $3,611 and its market cap is $425 billion. Ethereum’s NFT ecosystem continued to grow. Sales of CrypToadz rose 156%, hitting $56 million in the past week. MekaVerse also blew up. It’s amassed sales of $63 million, making it the 26th largest NFT project of all time. They are both crypto profile picture projects.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) token rose 240% to $0.000026 after Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, tweeted a picture of his dog. Musk’s dog, much to the enjoyment of Dogecoin 
fans and those of derivative projects, is a Shiba Inu. SHIB powers an Ethereum-based decentralized finance protocol, similar to Sushi. Dogecoin itself rose 12%.

QCP Capital said: “There are many reasons to be bullish; the stabilization of the Evergrande situation, possible upcoming approvals for BTC ETFs in the US, more traditional finance stalwarts like Soros Fund Management turning crypto-positive.” Yet equally, QCP said that lots of leveraged trading and a bearish options market could hint at bad things to come.

Bitcoinist has followed closely the rollout of The Bitcoin Law in El Salvador. Via the National Congress, this country gave BTC the status of legal tender, the implications of this action are still under scrutiny but point toward a new phase of adoption for the crypto industry.
Related Reading | News From El Salvador, Early October: The Chivo Ecosystem’s Stress Test
In a recent post, the CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX Alexander Höptner took a deeper look into the situation in El Salvador, the reasons why Bitcoin makes sense in developing countries, and the opposition given by financial international institutions. Höptner made the following prediction:
My prediction is that by the end of next year, we’ll have at least five countries that accept Bitcoin as legal tender. All of them will be developing countries.        
The executive based his arguments on the importance of Bitcoin in countries such as El Salvador. Long forgotten by the traditional finance system, they have little to no influence in the decisions that come from the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks around the globe.
They usually impact the way their citizens live, trade, send money over from abroad. The COVID-19 pandemic has proven that central banks are willing to expand their monetary supply, create inflation, and affect their population in order to maintain the system running.
Bitcoin is a way to opt-out of that system or, at the very least as Höptner said, to “choose to try something new”. The executive said:
What the critics fail to recognize is that developing countries like El Salvador are leading the world in embracing decentralized digital currencies and payments. They’ve had decades to analyze how the global financial system works – and doesn’t work – for their populations.
According to the CEO of BitMEX, there are 3 major variables that will play an important role in fulfilling his prophecy: remittances, politics, inflation. The first is 
one of Bitcoin’s most relevant use cases, and one of the main reasons why El Salvador decided to implement its BTC law.
Related Reading | By The Numbers: How Much Western Union And MoneyGram Will Lose From El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law
For the executive, remittances are a factor that “cannot be overstated” especially in developing countries around the world. In El Salvador alone, remittance accounts for over 20% of the country’s GDP in 2020.
Quoting data from the World Bank, Höptner claims that 75% of the global remittances are received by low and middle-income countries.
A large portion of that is lost to third-party companies that provide the service, right until a population discovers how much cheaper it’s to send money via Bitcoin or its second-layer solution, the Lightning Network. The CEO of BitMEX said:
US$540 billion in remittances reached low and middle income countries in 2020. That number would be a lot higher – and families in developing countries would be in a better position – with a cheaper method of remitting funds.
Additional data cited by Höptner from the IMF predicts average inflation of 5.4% for developing countries and 2.4% in developed countries. This will create incentives for people to look for alternatives to fiat currency and traditional investments to protect themselves from the impact on “consumer goods and services”.
As an example, the executive mentioned the increase in crypto adoption in Turkey. The national currency of this country has been heavily hit by inflation. Conversely, Bitcoin and crypto adoption surged.
Finally, Höptner pointed out that the Bitcoin Law in El Salvador will have other politicians in different countries trying to implement similar measures to their benefit. Crypto has become a “cultural touchstone”, a symbol of the lack of trust and faith in traditional institutions.

Thus, politicians could attempt to capture the interest of young people and those that lost their faith in the status quo. This has the potential for great success, but not without its risks:
(…) it’s also true that any failings by these leaders in the implementation phase may hurt wider adoption of cryptocurrencies in general. That’s the dangerous dilemma that lies ahead.
At the time of writing, BTC trades at $55,130 with a 1.8% profit in the daily chart.

BTC had an impressive run this week, managing to push above a key downtrend line and the September high at $52.9k. It managed to hit an intraweek high of $56.1k, digging deeper into the $55k to $58k zone of technical and on-chain resistance. The rally so far has shown profit-taki...
BTC had an impressive run this week, managing to push above a key downtrend line and the September high at $52.9k. It managed to hit an intraweek high of $56.1k, digging deeper into the $55k to $58k zone of technical and on-chain resistance.
The rally so far has shown profit-taking from much younger coins, while the older cohorts continue to steadily hold. Although many weak hands who bought BTC above $50k 
earlier this year panic sold during the May liquidation wipe out, we can expect some remaining investors looking to break even add near term selling pressure, especially between $55k to $58k.
Given the technical and heavy on-chain realized price distribution in the $55k to $58k zone, it could take BTC multiple attempts to push above these levels, before confirming a large breakout towards the previous all time highs at $64.8k.
Near-term technicals, especially on the 4-hour chart, reached moderately overbought levels, suggesting a consolidation or small pullback is needed before preparing for 
the next major move. At the moment, BTC continues to remain above the September high at $52.9k, a very important level. Bitcoin needs to make a weekly close above it in order to continue the breakout and validate the bear trap.
A weekly close above $52.9k is a very bullish signal and increases the probability of retesting the $55k to $58k zone of resistance. The more resistance is tested, the 
weaker it becomes, further increasing the probability of breaking above resistance if enough buyers come into the market.
In addition to BTC reaching near-term overbought levels, the past few days saw a slight uptick in spot exchange reserves, as younger coins began to take profit. This is a near term cautious signal, but we have to keep in mind reserves remain at multi-year lows.
Spot exchange reserves have been trending lower the entire year, as investors continued to buy BTC and withdraw from exchanges, adding to the massive supply shock.     
Bitcoin bulls are anxiously waiting for the weekly close to see if BTC can push above the critical $52.9k level. If they can maintain buying pressure and push BTC above $58k, the probability of retesting all-time significantly increases, as there is much less resistance above $60k.
Global Risk-On Trade Coming Back?
The SPX managed to hold a key intraweek low and printed multiple daily closes higher suggesting a double bottom and reversal developing. The dollar has been flat with money flowing out of longer-term bonds suggesting the risk-on trade could be coming back as investors attempt to get past near term uncertainties.
Overall, the trend in fundamental, technicals, and on-chain remain firmly bullish, as the long term holders firmly held despite this year’s severe drawdowns, FUD, liquidation events, and uncertainty. The recent price action has shown the bulls are firmly gaining back control from the bears. The outperformance of Bitcoin relative to other risk assets during major risk-off events in September is a major sign of strength for the largest cryptocurrency, suggesting continuing outperformance once markets 
resume risk on.
The weekly close relative to $52.9k will likely determine BTC’s direction for the coming weeks.

Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis beefed up her crypto portfolio less than two weeks after an unsuccessful attempt to insert an amendment into the controversial Senate-passed infrastructure bill, CNBC report revealed.
The post Bitcoin (BTC) in Congress: Senator Lummis discloses ...

Crypto-friendly Wyoming Senator purchased a substantial amount of Bitcoin back in August, an overdue filling revealed.
Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis beefed up her crypto portfolio less than two weeks after an unsuccessful attempt to insert an amendment into the controversial Senate-passed infrastructure bill, CNBC report revealed.
An overdue filing on Thursday showed that Wyoming State Senator reportedly bought up to $100,000 worth of Bitcoin (BTC) on August 16.
Senator’s August purchase of Bitcoin worth between $50,001 and $100,000 was filed on Thursday, and as such, disclosed outside of the 45-day reporting deadline set by The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, according to CNBC.
According to the Act, members of Congress are required to disclose their individual stocks, bonds and commodity futures sales and purchases within 45 days following the transaction.
“Once we realized it we worked with the Ethics committee to fix it,” a spokesperson at Lummis’ office told CNBC, stating that the delay was “an honest mistake,” caused 
by “a filing error,” and that “the issue has been resolved without penalty.”
Lummis’ August investment marked one of the first congressional cryptocurrency purchases, according to Quiver Quantitative, the report noted.
The alternative data company that tracks senators’ trading activities disclosed that the only other significant bet in crypto was made by Pat Toomey, as Pennsylvania Senator bought up to $15,000 of Grayscale Ethereum Trust and up to $15,000 Grayscale Bitcoin Trust in June, CNBC revealed, citing Quiver Quantitative.
The Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment to the controversial infrastructure bill, which attempted to limit the problematically broad definition of who qualifies as a crypto broker, failed to pass due to a surprise intervention by Senator Richard Shelby, two weeks prior Lummis grew her stake in Bitcoin.
Lummis’ Bitcoin disclosure drew attention in the past, noted the report, reminding that earlier in April she filed her annual financial disclosure form with the Senate, without including Bitcoin. An amended disclosure, which she filed a week later, uncovered Lummis owned between $100,000 and $250,000 worth of Bitcoin.
In June, the Wyoming Senator disclosed to the press that she owned five Bitcoin, revealing that she started investing in the crypto back in 2013, when its price was at 
$330.

Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania said that China’s authoritarian crackdown on crypto should be taken as an advantage by the US.
The House Rules Committee has blocked infrastructure bill changes and voted 220-212 to lock in the procedure, with a resolution approved on Tuesday afternoon.
In a Tuesday interview with news outlet CNBC, US Senator Cynthia Lummis said Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be a part of one’s retirement portfolio alongside other assets as they are a good store-of-value.

The Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) may approve four bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) on its desk for a decision this month.
Gary Gensler, the Biden appointed SEC chairman, has strongly hinted that ETFs under the more stringent Investment Company Act of 1940, rather than the Securities Act1933, may be approved.
A number of such ETFs have been filed, and they’re now for a decision with James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, stating:
“We are pretty bullish on approval here. We just can’t see Gensler and the SEC going out of their way to state positive comments about a 1940-act Bitcoin futures ETF at the end of September and then denying all of them less than a month later.”
Such potentially approved ETFs are expected to be based on bitcoin futures with Barry Silbert, who runs the stock traded Grayscale bitcoin and crypto trusts, stating: “word of the day: contango.”
Contango is a situation where the futures price of a commodity is higher than the spot price. His suggestion obviously being there will be more demand for an ETF than spot buying.
Such a situation can only arise if there is no arbitrage opportunity. That may be the case with a futures based ETF as you can’t redeem the asset, but you can potentially hedge.
A futures ETF moreover would be more volatile as it would be subject to expiring futures contracts at the end of each month. A spot ETF thus would probably be more appealing for long term investors, but it would probably be more expensive due to insurance requirements for custody holdings.
“Ready to tango,” Zhu Su of Three Arrows Capital said in reply to Silbert, suggesting some in the crypto space are excited about these new potential ETFs.
“The odds of approval in the next month are better than 50/50,” said Dave Nadig, chief investment officer at data-provider ETF Trends.
So eight years on, crypto may finally get its ETF which could open the way for more institutional long term investors.

   October 9, 2021 1:26 pm 0
The Biden administration is considering an executive order on cryptocurrencies in an apparent attempt to bypass Congress, and thus the voting public.
The draft order is all encompassing, dealing with jurisdictional responsibilities between different agencies as well as competition policy, research and innovation, national security, and so on.
The problem is apparently no one around Biden knows much about crypto. While the Deputy National Security Advisor Daleep Singh, a veteran of the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is directly involved in the work, Tim Wu, a special assistant to the president for technology and competition policy with knowledge of crypto, is recused “because of his personal holdings.”
Previously it was revealed he has between $1 million and $5 million in bitcoin, as well as between $100,001 and $250,000 in Filecoin.
If it was something like Shiba Inu then maybe it would be understandable recusing him, and since he doesn’t have eth then maybe he is no expert at all, but a token something is better than Fed regulating crypto.
That’s like putting Blockbuster in charge of regulating Youtube. Or better still, it’s like having Putin in charge of electing US presidents, or who was it this time?  
Ah of course, Janet Yellen received nearly one million from Citadel, but she was not recused from advising the president on the GME saga at its height back in January/February.
Gary Gensler, the SEC chair, has about $100 million in stocks through family trusts, as well as a yet to be paid pension from Goldman Sachs, but he’s in charge of regulating those very stocks and that very Goldman Sachs.
The new SEC General Counsel received millions from Citi, Citadel and other banks, yet he’s meant to, if necessary, sue those very banks.
But this crypto guy can’t have an opinion on crypto because he has crypto, and we’re to believe that’s the real reason?
Obviously we’ll have to wait for the draft, if it is published, before forming an opinion, but the President is not meant to make law, that’s Congresses’ job. Moreover 
their own admission they do not have expertise on something they want to regulate, suggests either incompetence or malice if they do go ahead with it in a way that is not acceptable to the crypto space.
Those procedural irregularities may have this stricken down in court as the President does not have constitutional powers to give Fed or SEC any authority, or to take any away.
He may however try and claim ’emergency’ because ‘ransomware’ with the measures ‘temporary,’ but he’s not dealing with the boomer generation anymore, so that would be limited to any ransomware measures.
Biden therefore may take a cue from this lack of expertise and realize that he doesn’t have the expertise because it is too new and too young to regulate.
When it comes to stablecoins for example, is it really for just one man to decide whether they should be guaranteed by the taxpayer or otherwise, and is the public really ready for that debate?
Where it concerns tokens, SEC claims the Security Act 1933 applies, so that act itself or a new one is needed to reform/replace, with one bill presented to Congress, but it hasn’t been taken up yet.
So Biden should focus on stuff he knows and leave crypto to a new generation. Considering his age, he is maybe  a one term president, and so in 2024 we hopefully get a 
young candidate because we’re a bit fed up with these boomers.
Then, once expertise isn’t an issue, we can have the debate, not least because crypto would be a bit more mature too while right now it is evolving way too fast for any regulation to not become outdated in months.
Otherwise any such executive order would have to be very favorable to this space if the obvious appearance of bias, incompetence and irregularities is to be overcome, and since Joe Biden is at risk of being perceived as an anti-innovation president which may have electoral consequences for the entire Democratic party, a favorable executive order is not out of the question but the proper podium is Congress where we can have a proper debate concerning generational matters.

Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin has slammed Bitcoin maximalists for “uncritically praising” Nayib Bukele
Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently criticized El Salvador’s approach to adopting Bitcoin, describing it as “reckless” in a comment he left on r/CryptoCurrency, the largest cryptocurrency-related subreddit.    

Buterin believes that forcing businesses to accept any cryptocurrency runs counter to the ethos of the space.

The Russian-Canadian programmer adds that Salvadorans are at risk of falling victim to hacks or scams because of a lack of education.

In a follow-up comment, Buterin derided Bitcoin maximalists as a community that is easily swayed by powerful allies:  
Bitcoin maximalists are a very easy community to get to praise you: you just have to be in a position of power and do or say nice things about them and their coin.     
Last month, Buterin also slammed Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey for attempting to re-create decentralized finance on Bitcoin with “a much weaker trust model.”   

His most recent comments were not left unnoticed by the Bitcoin community, whose members accused Buterin of being “salty” and hypocritical.
Feed me all of this salt. No one bats an eye when governments around the world force their citizens to use fiat currencies like the dollar. Once one makes it so businesses have to accept the best free market money to ever exist, it's a big problem.

As reported by U.Today, El Salvador became the first country to adopt the borderless and decentralized cryptocurrency as its official currency.

Opponents, however, argue that the budget allocating to the great Bitcoin experiment could have been used for improving the country’s healthcare or education systems.  
 
It is mandatory for merchants to accept Bitcoin in early September despite President Nayib Bukele stating that it would be voluntary less than two months before the law came into effect.

Yet, some Bitcoiners believe that mandatory acceptance is necessary in order to force international corporations of the likes of McDonald’s to accept Bitcoin.
Devil's advocate take on mandatory #Bitcoin acceptance in El Salvador:

- the government knew that foreign institutions & governments would try to stop them
- foreign multinationals are present in El Salvador
- large corps would come under pressure to boycott #Bitcoin as tender
Bukele, who recently jokingly called himself “the world's coolest dictator,” doesn’t back down from his support of Bitcoin, vowing the community with the government’s multi-million purchases and the video footage of a mining operation powered by volcanic energy.

Bitcoin (BTC) spot reserves in exchanges have been falling since the bull market started back in March 2020. The level of BTC held in exchanges has reached the same level as in October 2017. This is according to recent research conducted by CryptoQuant, a blockchain-analysis company. The main question remains: why are BTC being withdrawn from exchanges?
Bitcoin spot reserves are now at one of their lowest levels in the last four years. This is according to CryptoQuant that usually conducts these types of analyses to understand the current situation of Bitcoin in the market. 
The analysis shows that when the bull market started in March 2020, reserves in exchanges have been constantly falling. However, when reserves experienced an increase (people were depositing funds in crypto exchanges), the price of Bitcoin dropped or trended lower. 
It is also worth pointing out that during the bull market experienced in 2017, Bitcoin reserves in spot exchanges surged rather than declined. But this could be related to other market trends such as the fact that exchanges were not so common back in 2017 as they are now. 
Thus, a large number of Bitcoin holders that did not have enough liquidity to sell their BTC tokens saw a great opportunity to sell them as the price started moving higher. This bull market that started in 2020 has different underlying conditions that make holding Bitcoin a much more valuable thing than 4 years ago. 
This bull market is pushed by the need of holding a scarce asset in a moment in which governments are not only increasing their surveillance on individuals but also printing large amounts of money. The current low-rate environment, QE policies and rising commodity prices are pushing people to safe-haven assets such as Bitcoin.        
Let’s not forget that Bitcoin is not backed by any centralized authority and it is also free from government control. Thus, it is possible to use it as a store of value despite its volatility. Over the last year, Bitcoin has massively grown and reached new all-time highs. 
In May this year, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of over $64,000. Right now, BTC is being traded at close to $55,000 and other virtual currencies are following the same trend as Bitcoin. It is just a matter of time to understand whether Bitcoin will continue growing in the coming months.

According to El Mundo, identity thieves have targetted the Chivo wallet leading to further doubts around Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador.
The post El Salvador&#8217;s Chivo Bitcoin (BTC) wallet is rife with identity fraud appeared first on CryptoSlate.

Earn up to 12% APY on Bitcoin, Ethereum, USD, EUR, GBP, Stablecoins & more.
Scammers have stolen identities to claim the wallet sign-up bonus.
According to El Mundo, identity thieves have targetted the Chivo wallet leading to further doubts around Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador.
President Bukele sold the idea of Bitcoin as legal tender based on “banking the unbanked” and reducing overseas remittance fees. Payments to friends and family from Salvadorians living and working abroad account for 22% of the country’s GDP.
But public backlash and international pressure against the move continue to mount. Now, with reports of poor wallet security, maintaining that line is increasingly more difficult to do.
Then again, do crypto advocates expect too much?
Week 4 since El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment went live, and things are not going as planned.
Not only was the process marred by increasingly violent public protests, but the administration has also faced international resistance with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund leading the charge.
To top things off, this week, it emerged that some Salvadorians discovered that scammers had enabled their accounts without consent.
Wallet registration happens via a Unique Identity Document (DUI), a telephone number, date of birth, and a photo upload.
But social media is awash with reports of people claiming their DUI was already activated, and the Bitcoin bonus was withdrawn.
“My DUI has also been registered in the Chivo App without my knowledge. Magnificent security standards that the government app manages to transact money.”
In a bid to boost adoption, the Chivo Wallet offered $30 worth of Bitcoin as an incentive for citizens to sign up.
On September 25, three weeks from going live, President Bukele tweeted that over 2 million Salvadorians had downloaded the wallet. He added that the uptake was greater 
than that of people signing up for bank accounts.
2.1 million Salvadorans are ACTIVELY USING @chivowallet (not downloads).
Chivo is not a bank, but in less than 3 weeks, it now has more users than any bank in El Salvador and is moving fast to have more users that ALL BANKS IN EL SALVADOR combined.
This is wild!#Bitcoin🇸🇻
— Nayib Bukele 🇸🇻 (@nayibbukele) September 25, 2021

However, the question is, how many Chivo Wallets were activated by scammers only looking to steal the $30 bonus?
It’s worth remembering that Bitcoin’s rollout as legal tender in El Salvador is an experiment.
While some have criticized the speed of the rollout, which was announced in June and launched in September, it’s fair to say that the project was being worked on long before June.
“The president forced out the project out of the oven. You don’t adapt a national currency in just months.”
Nonetheless, in many ways, having longer (than four months) to refine the wallet further suggests a lack of thorough development and testing.
Another Reddit user pointed out that crypto folks expect too much, as far as changing the world is concerned. Adding that El Salvador has more significant and pressing 
problems than “blind adoption” can fix.
“People in this sub live with hopium not realising crypto and Bitcoin will not solve the problems of a country filled with unrest, crime, and corruption.
Adoption is great, but blind adoption is not a solution, especially for developing countries facing much bigger problems that put in risk the lives of its people.”

During the last day preceding the controversial Bitcoin (BTC) legislation coming into effect in El Salvador, the legal advisor to the presidency, Javier Argueta, got caught in the local media web as contradictory statements about the obligation of entrepreneurs to use the government’s official digital wallet, dubbed Chivo, flooded the headlines.
El Salvador’s proprietary ‘Chivo’ Bitcoin wallet officially launched earlier this week, but users have already been struggling with bugs within the app’s interface.    
A new tweet from El Salvador’s President, Nayib Bukele has hinted that the mass adoption of the leading digital asset, Bitcoin, in the country is still growing en masse as more money is being used to purchase the coin.

to 94.3%, despite the cryptocurrency’s distance from its all-time high.
According to data shared by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode on social media, the last time this many network entities were in profit was before the cryptocurrency large sell-off in May, which ultimately saw it drop from a $64,000 all-time high to a low under $30,000 before recovering.
Over the last few days, the percentage of entities in a state of profit surged 16.2% as the price of the cryptocurrency moved from $45,000 to a $55,000 high, according 
to CryptoCompare data.

Investments, Leah Walk, has revealed during an interview she believes the price of the flagship cryptocurrency will move up over the fourth quarter of the year, without risking a price prediction.
Notably, the third person to ever own bitcoin, the CEO of blockchain technology company Blockstream Adam Back, has said bitcoin hitting the $100,000 mark this year is “quite possible,” and even suggested that BTC trading at $500,000 in the long run is feasible.
